# Financial-Document-Summarization-Project-NLP
•Developed an AI-driven summarization system to extract and condense critical information from financial documents, enhancing efficiency for stakeholders.

•Utilized Hugging Face Transformers (BART) for abstractive summarization and deployed the model with MPS on Apple’s GPU for accelerated processing.

•Engineered a pipeline to extract and preprocess text from PDFs using PyPDF2, ensuring clean and structured inputs for the summarization model.

•Implemented chunking logic to process large documents, dynamically adjusting input/output lengths for efficient summarization.

•Designed and deployed an interactive web application using Streamlit, enabling users to upload financial PDFs and receive concise, actionable summaries.

•Optimized summarization accuracy through dynamic adjustment of model parameters, ensuring outputs were contextually relevant and well-structured.
